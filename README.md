This is the analysis codes for our paper: The Contribution of Ethnicity to the Association of MTHFR Variants C677T and A1298C with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Meta-Analysis.
https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci16010093

Our study looked at the association of two MTHFR variants C677T and A1298C and ASD. We highlighted the association between ASD and the MTHFR C677T variant, but not A1298C. Through exploring the heterogeneity by meta-regression on race/ethnicity, we found that the African (Egyptian) cohort with MTHFR C677T variants had a higher ASD susceptibility than Asian or European cohorts.

This repo includes the following four major statistical analyses in the paper:
1) We pooled odds ratio of ASD among MTHFR C677T or A1298C homozygous individuals compared to control cohorts using a random effect model.
2) Univariate meta-regression to identify race/ethnicity differences in the association of MTHFR C677T and A1298C with ASD.
3) Multiple meta-regressions to adjust for potential study-level covariates, including publication year, diagnostic tool (DSM-IV, DSM-V, or others), and study quality, assessed as the total Newcastle–Ottawa Scale Star score.
4) Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis to check robustness of the meta-analysis.
